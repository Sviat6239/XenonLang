# Example of an internal class
internal class Manager {
    var department: string = "IT";  # Internal variable
    fun getDepartment(): string {
        return department;
    }
}

# Testing the class
var m: Manager = new Manager();
print(m.getDepartment());  # Output: IT (access only within the assembly)
